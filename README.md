# Dark-Channel-Dehaze
By the reference of the Hekaiming's paper "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior", I implemented the main procedures on python.  
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.672.3815&rep=rep1&type=pdf This is the download link of that paper.  
I programed it for the assignment of Digital Image Processing. The professor commanded me to crystallize the algothrim to reduce the haze effect in landscapes. I surely mastered the algothrim in textbook(Histogram equalization), however, it is tedious for me. As a result of this, I searched in Google for an advanced method(Dark Channel).  
Eventually, I finished the majority of functions except the guide filter, which is not arranged in my Major(Software Engineering) curriculum. And the processing of learning it is killing me. Sorry for it.
